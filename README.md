# Ez RRule Generator

An alternative RRule Generator made using React, Tailwind, and daisyUI. Simply supply a callback function to the component's onChange attribute to handle the created date repetition rule. Optionally supply a start date object using the component's startDate attribute, today's date is used by default.

Ex: `<EzRRule onChange={(c) => console.log(c)} startDate={new Date()} />`

Make sure to follow all installation instructions for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/).
